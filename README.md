# OpaTester
Just your ordinary OPA SOAP/Rest Web Service Utility Tool. Basically a one stop shop to test and check OPA Web Services. 
</br>
Basically our monolithic application consumes 15 objects that are all external to our application. These objects are from Oracle Sales Cloud and for us to get the metadata and use the services for each, we need them up and running all the time!

#Reason for developing
I just want to help our team with all these external services that's mandatory for our development

#Features
+ OPA Services Check Tool - just a basic HTTP/S checks on all Web Service Available</br>
+ OPA Payload sender tool - just to send a payload to a specific exposed endpoint URL</br>
+ OPA Payload Getter - listens to Weblogic EM given an instance to grab real time payload for testing and development purposes</br>
...More features to come!

#Technologies - Front end
+ angularjs 1.x</br>
+ bootstrap 2.x</br>

#Technologies - Backend
+ Java 1.8</br>
+ Jersey (Rest)</br>
+ Weblogic 12c

</br>
I use JDeveloper for developing this application. This is because I myself also want to be familiar with the IDE (it's actually great btw!).
